# Machine Learning in C

## Why?

* Because I'm a masochist and all the million abstractions made in python confuse me, so I'm doing them in C following a number of resources in the hopes of getting a better understanding of these algorithms.
* The goal is to use this as a stepping stone into ML.

### These implementations are neither the best way to implement these models nor are they the most efficient

* To run any of these files do:

 ```bash
 $ ./build.sh 2_xor 
 // without the .c extension
 ```
